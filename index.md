## Status History

### 29-October, 2020

12:15 - 12:25 Central Time (U.S. & Canada)

**Type:**  
High response times

**Notes:**  
Abnormally high response times were observed during a brief period. After investigation this appears to have been an isolated incident related to an individual player's websocket connection during a match.

### 22-October, 2020

16:40 - 16:50 Central Time (U.S. & Canada)

**Type:**  
Planned Maintenance

**Reason(s):**

- Add "First 9" data for all completed matches
- Add "First 9" data for all player season stats

**Notes:**  
The addition of the "First 9" match average statistic required us to re-process the all match and season stats on the platform. Before undergoing this migration we first captured a backup of the production database to allow us to rollback in the event of any data corruption.
